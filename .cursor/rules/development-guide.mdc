# Development Guide

## Setup and Running
- Set up environment variables according to [env.example](mdc:env.example)
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` followed by `npm start` for production

## API Development
When working with the API routes:
1. Use [verifyAuth](mdc:utils/auth.ts) for authentication checks
2. All API routes should be created using Next.js route handlers
3. API routes should follow the pattern: `app/api/{feature}/{endpoint}/route.ts`

## Stream Responses
For streaming responses like in [app/api/team/call/route.ts](mdc:app/api/team/call/route.ts):
- Use ReadableStream for creating streaming responses
- Set proper headers: `'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache', 'Connection': 'keep-alive'`
- Handle timeouts and errors appropriately

## Environment Configuration
- Required environment variables are checked on startup
- JWT authentication requires proper secret configuration
